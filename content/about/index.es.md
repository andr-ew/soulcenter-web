      ## Process

      ### I seek to create a safe, humorous and collaborative space for clients to explore their own ability to access greater insight, clarity and self-awareness.

      spanish My approach is authentic, relational and informed by Internal Family Systems (IFS) and in-depth psychology (Spiritual) principles - and tailor (word better) each session to my client’s particular needs and strengths.

      ## Specializations

      Furthermore, I work with individuals who are seeking to engage in Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP) and can also provide a clinical assessment, preparation and integration service for those seeking support around independent use of plant medicine. (word better).

      ## Internal Family Systems Therapy

      Internal Family Systems (IFS), also referred to as ‘parts work’ is an evidence-based model of psychotherapy.

      ### The premise behind this model suggests that a person’s psyche is comprised by a multiplicity of parts (sub-personalities) that hold different emotions, beliefs, and behaviors. 

      These parts, along with a core Self, interact and influence our experiences, thoughts, and behaviors. IFS therapy aims to help individuals understand and collaborate with their parts, fostering a sense of unity, balance and compassionate self-leadership. 

      I am a trained IFS therapist through the Internal Family Systems model and have received a 
      Level 1 certification.
